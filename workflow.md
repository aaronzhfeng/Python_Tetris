## Phase 1: Requirements & Design  
**Goals:**  
- Define scope: classic 10×20 grid, seven standard tetrominoes, single‐player only  
- List core features: piece spawn/movement/rotation, line clears, scoring, level progression, next‐piece preview, pause/game-over screens  
- Sketch basic UI wireframes (grid, score panel, controls)

**Deliverables:**  
- Feature spec doc  
- Wireframe sketches (paper or digital)

---

## Phase 2: Environment & Project Setup  
**Tasks:**  
1. Create a Python 3.10+ virtual environment  
2. Install dependencies:
   - `pygame`  
3. Initialize a Git repository (with `.gitignore` for `__pycache__`, virtualenv, etc.)  
4. Lay out folder structure:

   ```text
   tetris/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── main.py
   │   ├── settings.py
   │   ├── board.py
   │   ├── tetromino.py
   │   ├── game.py
   │   └── utils.py
   ├── assets/
   │   ├── fonts/
   │   └── sounds/
   ├── tests/
   ├── requirements.txt
   └── README.md
````

**Deliverables:**

* Repo initialized on GitHub (or GitLab)
* `src/` skeleton files and `requirements.txt`

---

## Phase 3: Core Game Loop & State Management

**Tasks:**

* In `main.py`, initialize Pygame, set up window, clock, and enter the main game loop.
* Define high-level states: `MENU`, `PLAYING`, `PAUSED`, `GAME_OVER`.
* Wire up a simple state machine in `game.py` to switch states.

**Deliverables:**

* Blank window running at 60 FPS
* Pressing a key transitions between at least two states (e.g. MENU → PLAYING)

---

## Phase 4: Input Handling & Controls

**Tasks:**

* In the PLAYING state, capture key events (`←`, `→`, `↓`, `↑`/`Z`/`X`, `space` for drop).
* Map events to game-actions in `game.py` (move left/right, soft drop, rotate, hard drop).

**Deliverables:**

* On‐screen debug text showing which action was triggered by each key

---

## Phase 5: Game Logic & Mechanics

**Tasks:**

1. **Tetromino Representation** (`tetromino.py`):

   * Define shape matrices and rotation states for all seven pieces
2. **Board Logic** (`board.py`):

   * 10×20 grid data structure
   * Collision detection: check if a piece can occupy a given position/rotation
   * Lock-down logic: when a piece lands, merge it into the grid
3. **Line Clearing & Scoring**:

   * Detect and clear full rows
   * Update score based on lines cleared at once
   * Increase level every N lines → speed up drop interval

**Deliverables:**

* Pieces falling and stacking correctly
* Lines clear and score updates

---

## Phase 6: Rendering & UI

**Tasks:**

* Draw the playing field grid and occupied cells
* Colorize each tetromino
* Render next-piece preview and hold (optional)
* Display score, level, and lines cleared

**Deliverables:**

* Fully visible, colored game screen matching classic Tetris look

---

## Phase 7: Audio & Effects (Optional)

**Tasks:**

* Integrate sound effects for line clears, drops, rotations
* Add background music loop

**Deliverables:**

* Sound plays at appropriate game events

---

## Phase 8: Testing & Debugging

**Tasks:**

* Write unit tests for `board.py` collision and line-clear logic
* Manual QA: edge cases (rotating near walls, T-spin checks if you wish)
* Profile for performance hiccups

**Deliverables:**

* Passing test suite
* Known bug log with fixes applied

---

## Phase 9: Polish & UX

**Tasks:**

* Implement start menu, pause menu, and game-over screen with retry/quit options
* Animate transitions (fade in/out)
* Add title screen graphics and instructions

**Deliverables:**

* Seamless user experience from launch to game-over

---

## Phase 10: Packaging & Distribution

**Tasks:**

* Use PyInstaller or `shiv` to produce a standalone executable for Windows/Mac/Linux
* Write a clear `README.md` with install/run instructions, controls, credits
* Version-tag a release on GitHub

**Deliverables:**

* Publishable game build and GitHub release

---

## Phase 11: (Optional) CI/CD & Version Control Workflow

**Tasks:**

* Set up GitFlow or trunk-based‐development with feature branches
* Configure GitHub Actions (or similar) to run tests and lint on each push
* Automate packaging on tags

**Deliverables:**

* Green build badges on README
* Automated release pipeline
